**rssn** is an open-source scientific computing library for Rust, combining **symbolic computation**, **numerical methods**, and **physics simulations** in a single ecosystem.  
It is designed to provide a foundation for building a **next-generation CAS (Computer Algebra System)** and numerical toolkit in Rust.

## Project Status and Engineering Focus

Due to recent community discussions, some of which included unprofessional language, we have decided to **isolate the primary development focus** and move all related architectural discussions to **GitHub Discussions**. We have taken formal steps to address the inappropriate behavior.

Effective immediately, the majority of our resources will be dedicated to the **Dynamic Library (`cdylib`) version** of the core.

### Why the Pivot to FFI?

Our primary commitment is to provide **maximum stability, reliability, and institutional adoption** in high-stakes scientific computing environments (Fortran, C++, Python).

* **Focus:** We are implementing a highly robust **Handle-JSON Hybrid FFI** interface.
* **Goal:** To securely expose the `rssn` core's symbolic analysis capabilities via a stable C interface, ensuring **absolute isolation** from the internal Rust implementation.
* **Commitment:** We continue to validate the core with **property-based testing (`proptest`)** to guarantee professional-grade accuracy and zero failures in complex scenarios.

**Our best response to any doubt is uncompromising engineering quality and reliability.** Thank you for your support as we focus on delivering this critical FFI layer.

## ‚ú® Features

The library is organized into five major components:

- **Symbolic**:  
  Computer algebra system foundations, differentiation & integration, group theory, Lie algebras, polynomial algebra, PDE/ODE solvers, Grobner bases, quantum mechanics operators, graph algorithms, and more.

- **Numerical**:  
  Linear algebra, optimization (Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, Sphere, Linear Regression), numerical integration, probability distributions, FFT, combinatorics, special functions, PDE solvers (heat, wave, Schr√∂dinger 1D‚Äì3D), root finding, and statistical analysis.

- **Physics**:  
  Simulation modules covering FDM/FEM/FVM solvers, multigrid methods, molecular mechanics (SPH), electrodynamics (FDTD), Navier‚ÄìStokes fluid dynamics, relativity (geodesics, Schwarzschild), elasticity, quantum simulations, and more.

- **Output**:  
  Pretty-printing, LaTeX/Typst export, NumPy-compatible I/O, and plotting utilities (2D/3D surfaces, vector fields, parametric curves).

- **Plugins**:  
  Optional extensions (enabled with the `full` feature).

## üöÄ Quick Start

Add **rssn** to your Rust project:

```bash
cargo add rssn
````

Then start exploring:

```rust
use num_bigint::BigInt;
use rssn::symbolic::calculus::differentiate;
use rssn::symbolic::core::Expr;

fn test_differentiate_x_squared_stack_overflow() {
    let x = Expr::Variable("x".to_string());
    let x2 = Expr::Mul(Box::new(x.clone()), Box::new(x.clone()));
    let d = differentiate(&x2, "x");

    // The derivative of x^2 is 2*x.
    // The simplification process might result in Constant(2.0) or BigInt(2).
    let two_const = Expr::Constant(2.0);
    let expected_const = Expr::Mul(Box::new(two_const), Box::new(x.clone()));

    let two_int = Expr::BigInt(BigInt::from(2));
    let expected_int = Expr::Mul(Box::new(two_int), Box::new(x.clone()));

    println!("Derivative: {:?}", d);
    println!("Expected (const): {:?}", expected_const);
    println!("Expected (int): {:?}", expected_int);

    assert!(d == expected_const || d == expected_int);
}
```

## üí∞ Sponsorship & Donations

Scientific computing requires heavy resources for CI/CD, benchmarking, and cloud testing.
You can support development via **GitHub Sponsors**.

Enterprise sponsors will receive:

* Priority support from the core maintainers
* Ability to request features
* Direct collaboration on integration needs

Excess donations will be redirected to upstream Rust ecosystem projects (e.g., rust-LLVM) or community initiatives.

Updates:
Due to temporary issues, GitHub Sponsors is currently unavailable. If you would like to make a donation, please use PayPal to donate to [@panayang338](https://www.paypal.me/panayang338).
