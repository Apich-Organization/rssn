**rssn** is an open-source scientific computing library for Rust, combining a high-performance **symbolic computation** engine with **numerical methods** and **physics simulations**.

At its core, `rssn` utilizes a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to represent mathematical expressions, ensuring that they are always in a canonical form. This allows for highly efficient memory use and computational speed.

### A Note from the Author

As the primary author, I want to extend my deepest gratitude for your interest in this project. Please note that I am a high school student in mainland China with a deep passion for this field. Due to my academic commitments, my time is limited, and my responses to issues and pull requests may sometimes be delayed. I appreciate your patience and understanding, and I welcome every contribution from the community.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Efficient DAG-based Expression Model**: Expressions are stored as a canonical DAG, ensuring that identical subexpressions are represented by a single node in memory for maximum efficiency.
- **Advanced Symbolic Algebra**: A powerful Computer Algebra System (CAS) that goes beyond simple simplification:
  - **Polynomial Algebra**: Includes **Gr√∂bner basis** computation for solving polynomial systems.
  - **Simplification with Relations**: Can simplify expressions with respect to polynomial side-relations (e.g., simplifying `x^2` to `1 - y^2` given `x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0`).
- **Symbolic Calculus**: Functions for differentiation, integration, limits, and series expansion.
- **Numerical Methods**: A rich collection of algorithms for numerical integration, optimization, and solving differential equations.
- **Versatile Output**: Render expressions as pretty-printed text, LaTeX, or Typst.
- **Stable FFI Interface**: A robust C-compatible foreign function interface (`cdylib`) is available for integration with other languages like Python, C++, and Fortran.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Add **rssn** to your Rust project:

```bash
cargo add rssn
```

Then, perform a simple symbolic differentiation:

```rust
use rssn::symbolic::core::Expr;
use rssn::symbolic::calculus::differentiate;

// Define a variable 'x'
let x = Expr::new_variable("x");

// Define the expression: sin(x)
let expr = Expr::new_sin(x);

// Differentiate with respect to 'x'
let derivative = differentiate(&expr, "x");

// The result will be cos(x)
println!("The derivative of {} is: {}", expr, derivative);
```

For more advanced examples, such as simplification with relations, please see the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/rssn).

### Core FFI Concepts

The FFI is built around two core concepts:

1.  **Handles**: Rust objects (like symbolic expressions) are exposed to the C API as opaque pointers called "handles". You can pass these handles back to other FFI functions to operate on the objects they represent.
2.  **JSON Serialization**: Complex data is passed across the FFI boundary using JSON strings.

### Memory Management

**The caller is responsible for memory management.** When you create an object via an FFI function (e.g., `expr_from_json`), you receive a handle. When you are finished, you **must** call the corresponding `_free` function (e.g., `expr_free`) to release the memory. Similarly, when an FFI function returns a string (`*mut c_char`), you **must** call `free_string`.

### Basic Workflow

1.  **Create**: Use a `_from_json` function to create an object from a JSON string.
2.  **Operate**: Pass the handle to other FFI functions (e.g., `expr_simplify`).
3.  **Inspect**: If a function returns a string or a new handle, you own it.
4.  **Clean up**: Call the `_free` function on any handle or string you received.
