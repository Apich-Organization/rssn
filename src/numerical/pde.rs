//! # Numerical Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers
//!
//! This module provides numerical methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
//! It includes placeholder functions and examples for common PDE types like Heat, Wave, and Poisson
//! equations, typically using finite difference methods.
/// Solves a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).
///
/// NOTE: This is a placeholder function. Real-world PDE solvers are
/// computationally intensive and typically require specialized libraries
/// (e.g., dedicated physics or numerical analysis crates).
